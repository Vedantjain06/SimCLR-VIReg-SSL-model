# SimCLR-VIReg-SSL-model

This project aims to enhance time series classification accuracy, specifically for the UWaveGestureLibrary dataset, using self-supervised learning (SSL). SSL leverages large-scale unlabeled data to learn useful feature representations, which can improve downstream classification performance. In this project, we pre-trained on a separate dataset using self-supervised methods VICReg and SimCLR. VICReg, with its variance, invariance, and covariance regularization, ensures robust and diverse feature extraction, while SimCLR, a contrastive learning approach, encourages similar representations for augmented views of the same instance. After pre-training, we fine-tuned the model on the UWaveGestureLibrary data to maximize classification accuracy, effectively adapting the learned features to the gesture recognition task. This approach helps improve model accuracy by using SSL-extracted representations that capture essential time series characteristics.
